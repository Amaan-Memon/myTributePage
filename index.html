      <h2>Early Years</h2>
      <p><b>Christopher Brent Wood</b> (born September 19, 1995), better known by his stage name <b>Brent Faiyaz</b>, is an American singer from Columbia, Maryland. Faiyaz started making music at the age of 12. His parents were not always understanding of his dreams as a musician, which Faiyaz said was warranted as he was "always distracted" by his love for music.
      <h2>The Newcomer</h2>
      <p> Faiyaz began uploading his experimental music (Black Child EP) onto SoundCloud in 2014 and moved from his hometown Columbia, Maryland to Charlotte, North Carolina before settling in Los Angeles, California to further his music career. <br></br><img id="AMParadox" src="https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/300x300/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2Fa44315a64dad42882a3c5bcec34d504a.1000x1000x1.jpg" alt="A.M. Paradox" width="100px" height="100px"> On January 19, 2015, he released his debut single <b>"Allure"</b>. On June 1, 2016, Faiyaz released <b>"Invite Me"</b>, the lead single from his debut EP, entitled <b>A.M. Paradox</b>. It was released released on his 21st birthday and received positive reviews from music critics.
        <br></br>In October 2016, Faiyaz formed a group named Sonder with record producers Dpat and Atu. The group released their debut single, "Too Fast," on October 25.<br>

      </p>
      <h2>A Star in the Making</h2>
      <p>On January 26, 2017, Sonder released their debut EP Into, for which Duplion named them their "Artist of the Month" for January 2017. The EP was also ranked 23rd by Complex on its list of "The Best Albums of 2017 (So Far)" on June 6, 2017. <br>

He is currently working on a new album, titled Make It Out Alive, which is in the early recording process. <br></br><img id="Drake" src="https://resources.tidal.com/images/c6250935/aab2/4a23/a066/9e56733a355e/640x640.jpg" alt="Wasting Time" width="100px" height="100px">On July 1, 2021, Faiyaz released a new single, "Wasting Time" featuring Drake.

      <h2>Why do I like him?</h2>
      <p>Other than the fact we're both Virgos (which shines through in his music), Brent has a melodic and smooth vocal tone synonymous with R&B singers from the past e.g. Usher, Ne-Yo and Mario. However, like The Weeknd, he hides his dark and toxic nature when it comes to romance behind the silky smooth vocal runs. I am a singer myself and I the way he plays with the notes is pure bliss! </p>
